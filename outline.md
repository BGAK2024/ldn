# Linked Data Notifications

## Abstract



## Introduction

Linked Data Notifications is a specialised use of Linked Data Platform for sending and consuming notifications. It is not dependent on a complete implementation of LDP but designed to be compatible, and this specification describes the particular features necessary.

### Overview



### Summary

## Conformance

Implementations may be one or more of *senders*, *receivers* or *consumers*.

Senders generate the notification data, discover where to deliver it, and deliver it. Receivers advertise where notifications should be delivered to, and store them upon receipt, and optionally expose the notifications for use by consumers. Consumers discover where to read notifications from, and may do additional processing on them.
